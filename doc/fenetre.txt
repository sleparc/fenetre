INTRODUCTION                                    *fenetre-intro*

The Fenetre plug-in provides a very easy way to recover windows session when
starting your Vim editor. Windows are very powerful in Vim since you can 
split them and organize your view to your specific needs. Fenetre is the 
perfect tool to manage them.


REQUIREMENTS                                    *fenetre-requirements*

The plug-in requires Vim compiled with Ruby support, a compatible Ruby
installation at the operating system level, and a C compiler to build
the Ruby extension.


1. Vim compiled with Ruby support

You can check for Ruby support by launching Vim with the --version switch:

  vim --version

If "+ruby" appears in the version information then your version of Vim has
Ruby support.

Another way to check is to simply try using the :ruby command from within Vim
itself:

  :ruby 1

If your Vim lacks support you'll see an error message like this:

  E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version

The version of Vim distributed with Mac OS X does not include Ruby support,
while MacVim does; it is available from:

  http://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads

For Windows users, the Vim 7.2 executable available from www.vim.org does
include Ruby support, and is recommended over version 7.3 (which links against
Ruby 1.9, but apparently has some bugs that need to be resolved).


2. Ruby

In addition to having Ruby support in Vim, your system itself must have a
compatible Ruby install. "Compatible" means the same version as Vim itself
links against.

On Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the system comes with Ruby 1.8.7 and all recent
versions of MacVim (the 7.2 snapshots and 7.3) are linked against it.

On Linux and similar platforms, the linked version of Ruby will depend on
your distribution. You can usually find this out by examining the
compilation and linking flags displayed by the |:version| command in Vim, and
by looking at the output of:

  :ruby puts RUBY_VERSION

A suitable Ruby environment for Windows can be installed using the Ruby
1.8.7-p299 RubyInstaller available at:

  http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives

If using RubyInstaller be sure to download the installer executable, not the
7-zip archive. When installing mark the checkbox "Add Ruby executables to your
PATH" so that Vim can find them.


INSTALLATION                                    *fenetre-installation*

Fenetre was developed to be compatible with Pathogen, see next section for
installation details.


MANAGING USING PATHOGEN                         *fenetre-pathogen*

Pathogen is a plugin that allows you to maintain plugin installations in
separate, isolated subdirectories under the "bundle" directory in your
|'runtimepath'|. The following examples assume that you already have
Pathogen installed and configured, and that you are installing into
~/.vim/bundle. For more information about Pathogen, see:

  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332
  https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen


  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  git clone git://github.com/sleparc/fenetre.git

Once you have a local copy of the repository you can update it at any time
with:

  cd ~/.vim/bundle/fenetre
  git pull


USAGE                                           *fenetre-usage*

The window splits are autosaved on editor close but you can save them
manually. See next section for commands.


COMMANDS                                        *fenetre-commands*

                                                *:FenetreSaveSession*
|:FenetreSaveSession|  Go through all of the window locations and save their positions

                                                *:FenetreOpenSession*
|:FenetreOpenSession|  Opens up the windows saved in the session file
(~/.fenetre_session)
